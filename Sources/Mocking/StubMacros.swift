/// Sets a stub for a given function to return a provided output.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - function: The function to stub. The specified function must be a member of a `StubProviding` type.
///   - output: The output value to be returned when the function is called.
///
///   - Note: The compiler will not be able to disambiguate when stubbing functions that are overloaded *and* share the same output type.
///   If that is the case, use `#stub(_:using:)` and specify the input to the closure explicitly.

/// - Parameters:
///   - function: The function to stub. The specified function must be a member of a `StubProviding` type.
///   - error: The error to be thrown when the function is called.

/// Sets a stub for a given function using a closure to dynamically determine the output.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - function: The function to stub. The specified function must be a member of a `StubProviding` type.
///   - closure: A closure that takes in the function's input and returns the desired output when the function is called.
///
///   - Note: Macros do not seem to support trailing syntax currently, so you must specify the argument label `using`.
///   This also serves to disambiguate from `stub(_:returning:)` where the `Output` is a closure.
