/// This macro mocks the members of the struct or class that it is applied to.
///
/// Properties of the attached type should not be initialized inline (using an initializer is allowed, but not required)
/// and functions should not have bodies.
/// In most circumstances the attached type should conform to a protocol,
/// so an easy way to generate the member definitions is to just apply the fixit that pops up after adopting the protocol
/// and then delete the empty bodies of the functions.
///
/// This macro adds conformance to the `StubProviding` and `Spy` protocols. This allows you to stub out each method and expect that methods were called in your tests.
