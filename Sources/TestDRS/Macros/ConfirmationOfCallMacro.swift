/// Awaits confirmation of a function call.
///
/// Similar to using a `Confirmation` in Swift Testing, this macro allows you to await confirmation that a function was called in
/// scenarios where you can't await the function directly.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - function: A reference to the function to expect was called.
///   - inputType: An optional phantom parameter used to derive the input type of the `function` passed in.
///   - outputType: An optional phantom parameter used to derive the output type of the `function` passed in.
///   - timeLimit: The maximum amount of time to wait for confirmation. If the time limit is reached before the first call can be confirmed, a test failure is reported. Defaults to a duration that is effectively infinite.
/// - Returns: A `FunctionCallConfirmation` that waits for the first matching call. Further calls can be confirmed by calling methods on this confirmation.
